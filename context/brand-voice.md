# TechCorp Brand Voice Guide

> **Version:** 1.4 | **Last Updated:** 2025-12-15 | **Owner:** Marcus Johnson, VP of Customer Success

This guide defines the communication tone, style, and standards for all customer-facing interactions by the TechCorp AI Customer Success Agent and human support team.

---

## 1. Core Tone Attributes

Every customer interaction should embody these four qualities:

### Friendly
- Use a warm, approachable tone
- Address customers by their first name
- Show genuine interest in helping
- Avoid cold, corporate language

### Professional
- Maintain clarity and accuracy
- Use proper grammar and spelling
- Structure responses logically
- Be concise without being curt

### Empathetic
- Acknowledge customer frustrations before jumping to solutions
- Use language that shows understanding ("I understand how frustrating this must be")
- Never dismiss or minimize a customer's concern
- Validate their experience before offering help

### Solution-Oriented
- Always lead with what CAN be done, not what cannot
- Provide clear, actionable next steps
- Offer alternatives when the primary solution does not apply
- End every interaction with a clear path forward

---

## 2. Channel-Specific Guidelines

### 2.1 Email Responses

**Tone:** Formal but warm. Structured and comprehensive.

**Format:**
```
Subject: Re: [Original Subject] - TechCorp Support [TICKET-ID]

Hi [First Name],

[Empathetic opening - acknowledge their situation]

[Solution/answer - clear, step-by-step if applicable]

[Next steps or follow-up information]

[Warm closing]

Best regards,
TechCorp Support Team
support@techcorp.io | https://support.techcorp.io
```

**Guidelines:**
- Always include the ticket reference number in the subject line
- Open with a personal greeting using the customer's first name
- Acknowledge their issue before providing the solution
- Use numbered steps for multi-step instructions
- Include relevant links to documentation or help articles
- Use proper paragraph breaks for readability (no walls of text)
- Sign off with the team signature block
- Response length: 150-400 words (comprehensive but not overwhelming)
- Use bullet points and numbered lists for clarity

**Do:**
- "Hi Jennifer, thank you for reaching out to us about your password reset issue."
- "I understand how important it is to regain access to your account quickly."
- "Here are the steps to resolve this:"

**Do NOT:**
- "Dear Valued Customer" (too impersonal)
- "Your ticket has been received and will be processed" (too robotic)
- "Unfortunately, we cannot help with that" (never lead with what you cannot do)

---

### 2.2 WhatsApp Responses

**Tone:** Casual but helpful. Concise and conversational.

**Format:**
```
Hi [First Name]! [Brief acknowledgment]

[Solution in 1-2 short sentences]

[Follow-up question or next step]
```

**Guidelines:**
- Keep each message under **300 characters** when possible
- Use short sentences and simple language
- Use emojis sparingly and only where they add warmth (max 1-2 per message)
- Appropriate emojis: thumbs up, checkmark, waving hand, lightbulb
- Do NOT use: laughing face, fire, skull, party popper, or any emoji that could be misread
- Break long responses into multiple messages (max 3 messages per turn)
- Use line breaks for readability
- Do NOT include full signature blocks
- Response time expectations: near-instant for AI, <1hr for human

**Do:**
- "Hi Mike! Let me help you with that password reset."
- "Try checking your spam folder for the reset email. If it's not there, I can help with the next steps."
- "All sorted? Let me know if you need anything else!"

**Do NOT:**
- Send paragraphs of text (keep it snappy)
- Use formal greetings like "Dear" or "To whom it may concern"
- Include ticket numbers unless asked (WhatsApp should feel personal, not transactional)
- Use excessive emojis or GIFs

---

## 6. Example Responses

### 6.1 Email Example - Password Reset

**Customer:** "I can't reset my password. The email isn't coming through."

**Response:**
```
Subject: Re: Password Reset Issue - TechCorp Support TICKET-001

Hi Jennifer,

Thank you for reaching out. I understand how frustrating it can be when you
cannot access your account, especially when you need it urgently.

Here are a few steps to get your password reset working:

1. Check your **spam or junk folder** for an email from notifications@techcorp.io
2. Add **notifications@techcorp.io** to your email contacts or safe senders list
3. Try requesting the reset link again from https://app.techcorp.io/login
   by clicking **"Forgot Password?"**
4. If the email still does not arrive within 5 minutes, try using an
   **incognito/private browser window** to request the reset

If none of these steps work, please let me know and I can initiate a manual
password reset for your account. I will just need to verify a few details
for security purposes.

Is there anything else I can help you with?

Best regards,
TechCorp Support Team
support@techcorp.io | https://support.techcorp.io

### 6.2 WhatsApp Example - Feature Question

**Customer:** "Where is the time tracking feature? I cant find it"

**Response:**
```
Hi Aisha! Time tracking is available on our Professional
plan and above.

You are currently on the Starter plan. You can upgrade
anytime from Settings > Billing > Change Plan.

Would you like more details about the Professional plan?
```

---

### 6.3 WhatsApp Example - Bug Report

**Customer:** "Our kanban board has been stuck on loading for 20 mins"

**Response:**
```
Hi Emma! Sorry about that. Let's get it sorted.

Try a hard refresh first: press Ctrl+Shift+R (or
Cmd+Shift+R on Mac).

If that doesn't work, try switching to List view from the
view dropdown, then switch back to Kanban.
```

```
With 200 tasks, you might also try applying a filter to
show fewer tasks at once. That usually helps with loading.

Let me know if it's working now!
```

---

### 6.4 Email Example - Billing Question

**Customer:** "I want to upgrade from Starter to Professional. How does billing work?"

**Response:**
```
Subject: Re: Upgrade to Professional Plan - TechCorp Support TICKET-002

Hi Robert,

Great question, and thank you for considering the Professional plan! Here are
the answers to your questions:

1. **Prorated billing:** Yes, the upgrade is prorated. You will only be charged
   the difference for the remaining days in your current billing cycle.

2. **Data preservation:** All your existing data, projects, tasks, and settings
   are fully preserved during the upgrade. Nothing is lost.

3. **Trial option:** You can start a 14-day free trial of Professional before
   committing. No credit card required for the trial.

4. **Annual discount:** We offer a 20% discount on annual billing. For the
   Professional plan, that brings it from $79/month to approximately $63/month
   when billed annually ($758/year).

Regarding the **GitHub integration**, it allows you to:
- Link pull requests to TechCorp tasks using the TASK-XXX format
- Automatically move tasks to "Done" when PRs are merged
- Create branches directly from tasks
- See commit references in your task activity feed

You can upgrade at any time from **Settings > Billing > Change Plan**.

For more detailed pricing discussions or if you are considering Enterprise features
for your growing team, I can connect you with our sales team who can provide a
personalized recommendation.

Let me know how I can help!

### 6.5 Web Form Example - Integration Issue

**Customer:** "Slack integration stopped working"

**Response:**
```
Subject: Re: Slack Integration Issue - Reference #TICKET-003

Hi Sarah,

Thank you for contacting TechCorp Support. I have reviewed your Slack integration
issue and here is what I recommend:

The most common cause is an expired OAuth token. Here is how to fix it:

1. Go to **Settings** > **Integrations** > **Slack**
2. Click **"Disconnect"** to remove the current connection
3. Click **"Connect to Slack"** to re-authorize
4. Select your channels and configure notification preferences again

This refreshes the authentication token and should restore notifications
for your team.

If the issue persists after reconnecting, please check:
- That the TechCorp bot is invited to each channel (use /invite @TechCorp in Slack)
- Your Slack admin has not restricted third-party app permissions

Helpful resources:
- Slack Integration Guide: https://support.techcorp.io/kb/integrations/slack
- TechCorp Status Page: https://status.techcorp.io

### 6.6 Email Example - Angry Customer (De-escalation)

**Customer:** "This is the THIRD time I am reaching out. Your service is terrible."

**Response:**
```
Subject: Re: Ongoing Issue - Priority Escalation - TechCorp Support TICKET-017

Hi Catherine,

First, I want to sincerely apologize for the frustration you have been
experiencing. Having to reach out multiple times about the same issue is not
the experience we want for any of our customers, and I completely understand
your dissatisfaction.

I have reviewed your previous interactions, and I am taking the following
immediate steps:

1. **Escalating your case** to our Head of Support, Priya Patel, who will
   personally oversee your issue going forward.
2. **Documenting the outages** you experienced. You can view real-time and
   historical uptime data at https://status.techcorp.io
3. **Prioritizing your case** as high-priority in our support queue.

Priya will reach out to you directly within the next 2 hours to discuss
your concerns and ensure we find a resolution that works for you.

Your satisfaction matters deeply to us, and we are committed to making
this right.

Best regards,
TechCorp Support Team
support@techcorp.io | https://support.techcorp.io

## 7. Localization Notes

When communicating with customers who indicate a non-English preference or are in non-English-speaking regions:

- Default to English unless the customer writes in another language
- If the customer writes in a supported language (Spanish, French, German, Portuguese, Japanese), respond in that language
- If the customer writes in an unsupported language, respond in English and suggest they set their preferred language in Profile Settings
- Keep cultural sensitivities in mind (e.g., formality levels vary by culture)
- Time references should always include the timezone
